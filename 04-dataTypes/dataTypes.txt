string = sequence of characters. Must be in quotes or backticks
number = integers as well as floating-point numbers
boolean = logical entity / true or false
null = intentional absence of any object value
undefined = a variable that has not yet been defined / assigned
symbol = Built in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
BigInt = Numbers that are greater than the "Number" type can handle

/*Reference Types (Objects)*/
Reference types or objects are non-primitive values and when assigned to a variable, the variable is given a regerence to that value

Object literals, array and functions are all reference types

/*Static Typing vs Dynamic Types*/
JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language. This means we do not explicitly define the types for our variables. Many other languages are statically-typed such as C, C++, and Java.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which allows static-typing. This can make your code more verbose and less prone to errors. TypeScript may be something you want to look into later on
